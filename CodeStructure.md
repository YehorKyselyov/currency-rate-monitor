### Code Structure Overview

Currency Rate Monitor project is structured into several key modules and components. Here's a brief overview of the code structure and the important modules:

#### 1. **Program.cs**

This is the entry point of the application. It configures and starts the host, setting up the services and configuration needed for the application to run.

- **Main Method**: Initializes the host builder and runs the application.
- **CreateHostBuilder Method**: Configures app settings and services.

#### 2. **Worker.cs**

This class represents the background service that periodically fetches, processes, and saves currency rates. It uses the .NET Generic Host framework to run as a hosted service.

- **ExecuteAsync Method**: Main execution loop of the service.
- **ProcessCurrencyRates Method**: Handles the fetching, parsing, saving, and logging of currency rates.
- **FetchCurrencyRatesAsync Method**: Fetches currency rates from the configured API.
- **ParseCurrencyRates Method**: Parses the API response into a structured format.
- **SaveCurrencyRates Method**: Saves the parsed data to a file in the specified format.
- **LogCurrencyRates Method**: Logs the currency data to the console if enabled.

#### 3. **ControlHandler.cs**

Handles dynamic configuration updates via control codes. It listens for commands from the console and updates the application settings accordingly.

- **StartListening Method**: Starts listening for control commands.
- **ValidateInput Method**: Validates the input control commands.
- **UpdateAppSettings Method**: Updates the app settings based on the input command.

#### 4. **CurrencyData.cs**

Defines the data structures used to represent currency rates.

- **CurrencyData Struct**: Represents a single currency data entry.
- **CurrenciesData Class**: Represents a collection of currency data entries and includes methods for parsing XML input.

#### 5. **DataIO.cs**

Handles the input and output operations for currency data, including serialization and deserialization.

- **SaveData Method**: Saves currency data to a file.
- **LoadData Method**: Loads currency data from a file.

#### 6. **Interfaces and Serializers**

Defines the interface for data serialization and its implementations for different formats.

- **IDataSerializer Interface**: Defines methods for serializing and deserializing currency data.
- **JsonDataSerializer Class**: Implements JSON serialization.
- **CsvDataSerializer Class**: Implements CSV serialization.
- **XmlDataSerializer Class**: Implements XML serialization.

### Summary

- **Program.cs**: Configures and starts the application.
- **Worker.cs**: Core background service logic for fetching and processing currency rates.
- **ControlHandler.cs**: Dynamic configuration management via console commands.
- **CurrencyData.cs**: Data structures for currency rates.
- **DataIO.cs**: Handles data serialization and deserialization.
- **Interfaces and Serializers**: Defines and implements serialization methods for different formats.

This structure ensures that the application is modular, maintainable, and easy to extend with additional functionality or new serialization formats.
